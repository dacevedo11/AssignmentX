  <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Description:</b></span></h3>

  <p>Quests are a popular tool used in RPGs and MMOs. They can contain narrative or be as simple as retrieving an item for a reward.
    They normally are used as a way for developers to lead players to a planned experience. It’s an underlying tool to immerse
    players into a game.</p>

  <p>For this assignment, your goal is to create a game with playable quests, using the tool of your choice. These quests should
    also serve as a “key” to unlock more quests, whether directly, through an item, etc. Your game should contain some kind of
    lore to keep the player engaged and interested in the quest. The game should also include interactable NPCs to give information
    or to give out the quest itself.</p>
